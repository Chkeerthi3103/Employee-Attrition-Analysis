# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
**Project Overview**
This repository contains the final project for the Big Data course (AIT-580), which aims to analyze employee attrition in organizations. The project utilizes the "HR Employee Attrition" dataset, containing employee information from a company, to identify trends and factors that contribute to employee turnover and attrition. Through data preprocessing, visualizations, and analysis, this project provides insights that can help organizations improve employee retention strategies.

**Key Concepts:**
Employee Attrition refers to the gradual loss of workers in a company, either voluntarily (resignation, retirement) or involuntarily (termination).
Employee Turnover often refers to the process of employees leaving and being replaced, whereas attrition involves a permanent decrease in the workforce.
The primary goal of this analysis is to explore patterns that indicate the factors leading to employee attrition, such as salary, job role, performance rating, and years with the company.
